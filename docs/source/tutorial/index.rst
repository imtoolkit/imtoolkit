This webpage introduces a detailed tutorial for the ``imtoolkit`` command and APIs. Before using the command and the APIs, the CuPy-aided GPGPU acceleration is activated by setting an environment variable ``USECUPY=1`` as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    > export USECUPY=1

In case you would like to use the CPU backend, NumPy, please unset the environment variable.

.. code-block:: bash

    > unset USECUPY
